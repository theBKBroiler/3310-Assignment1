# 3310-Assignment1

This program was written for Dr. Ajay Gupta's CS 3310 - Data and File Structures course.

The Objectives of this program are to

1) Generate n random integers from 1 to m 

2) Store the generated numbers to a linked list (I used a doubly-linked list for efficiency)

3) Count how many numbers in the linked list are larger than 50 (range [50,m])

a) If there are more than 5 integers that are larger than 50, sort the data in the linked list in a non-decreasing order, then delete the 5th element

b) Otherwise, sort the linked list in a non-increasing order and delete the second element
    
4) Insert the number 10 to linked list in its correct place (don't destroy the sort-order)

5) Then, output the data in your final linked list

6) Redo steps 2-5 with array instead of linked list
